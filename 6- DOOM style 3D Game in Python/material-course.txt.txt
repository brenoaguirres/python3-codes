# Behaviour
- Wolfenstein 3D / DOOM is based on the raycasting algorithm which in reality is performed on a two dimensional plane but gives the illusion of a three dimensional space.


# Initial Setup
- pip install pygame
- 5 files (main.py, player.py, object_renderer.py, raycasting.py, map.py, settings.py)
- settings.py -> main game settings
